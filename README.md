## What is Ani-Mime?

A tiny always-on-top pixel dog that reacts to what your terminal is doing. It sniffs when you're building, barks when a dev server is running, sits when you're free, and sleeps when nothing's happening.

It also integrates with **Claude Code** — the dog knows when Claude is thinking vs waiting for you.

## Mascot States

| Status | Dot | Mascot | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Free** | Green | Sitting | Terminal idle, ready for commands |
| **Working** | Red (pulse) | Sniffing | Running a task (build, git push, etc.) |
| **Service** | Blue | Barking | Dev server launched (vite, metro, etc.) |
| **Searching** | Yellow (pulse) | Idle | Waiting for connection |
| **Sleep** | Gray | Sleeping | Terminal closed or 10s of inactivity |

## Features

- **Pixel Art Mascot** — animated sprite sheet dog above the status pill
- **Custom Sprites** — upload your own PNG sprite sheets via manual import or smart extraction with chroma-key background removal
- **Frame Range Expressions** — specify frames as ranges like `1-5` or `41-55,57,58` when importing custom sprites
- **Display Scale** — resize your mascot with Tiny / Normal / Large / XL presets
- **Manual Tagging** — zsh hooks classify commands as `task` or `service`
- **Heartbeat Architecture** — no process tree scanning, no time-based guessing
- **Claude Code Hooks** — tracks when Claude is actively working vs waiting
- **Multi-Session** — handles multiple terminals, priority: busy > service > idle
- **Auto-Setup** — first launch configures zsh hooks and Claude Code hooks via native macOS dialogs
- **All Workspaces** — visible on every macOS Space/desktop
- **Low Footprint** — Rust + Tauri, minimal CPU and RAM

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap vietnguyenhoangw/ani-mime
brew install --cask ani-mime
```

Open the app. On first launch, Ani-Mime will:
1. Ask to add a hook to your `~/.zshrc` (required for terminal tracking)
2. Ask to configure Claude Code hooks (optional)

Open a new terminal tab and the mascot starts reacting.

### Manual (from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vietnguyenhoangw/ani-mime.git
cd ani-mime
bun install
bun tauri dev
```

Then source the zsh script:

```bash
echo 'source "/path/to/ani-mime/src-tauri/script/terminal-mirror.zsh"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## Requirements

- **macOS** (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- **zsh** (default shell on macOS)
- **Claude Code** (optional) — for Claude activity tracking

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend:** Rust, Tauri v2, tiny_http
- **Shell:** zsh hooks (preexec / precmd)
- **Sprites:** CSS sprite sheet animation (128×128 pixel art, scalable)
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e)

---

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
bun run test

# E2E tests (requires dev server on :1420)
npx playwright test --config=e2e/playwright.config.ts
```

The e2e suite covers app startup, status transitions, speech bubbles, scenario mode, settings, custom sprite upload (including frame range expressions), sprite display sizing, and custom sprite editing.
