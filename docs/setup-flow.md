# Setup Flow

Ani-Mime runs an automatic setup on first launch to configure shell hooks and (optionally) Claude Code integration.

## What Gets Modified

### Shell RC Files

A `source` line is appended:

```bash
# --- Ani-Mime Terminal Hook ---
source "/Applications/ani-mime.app/Contents/Resources/script/terminal-mirror.zsh"
```

The path points to the bundled script inside the Tauri app bundle.

### Claude Code Settings

If the user opts in, hooks are added to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl -s --max-time 1 'http://127.0.0.1:1234/status?pid=0&state=busy&type=task' > /dev/null 2>&1" }]
    }],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl ... busy" }] }],
    "Stop": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl ... idle" }] }],
    "SessionStart": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl ... idle" }] }],
    "SessionEnd": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl ... idle" }] }]
  }
}
```

### MCP Server

If the user opts in to Claude Code, the MCP server is also registered in `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ani-mime": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/you/.ani-mime/mcp/server.mjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server script is copied from the bundled resources to `~/.ani-mime/mcp/server.mjs` on **every** app launch (not just first setup), so it stays up-to-date with app updates.

### Marker File

`~/.ani-mime/setup-done` — Presence of this file prevents setup from running again.

## Native Dialogs

All dialogs use macOS `osascript` (AppleScript):
- `display dialog` — Yes/No confirmations
- `choose from list` — Multi-select shell picker

This avoids depending on a GUI framework for setup dialogs.

## Re-running Setup

To re-run setup:
1. Delete `~/.ani-mime/setup-done`
2. Restart the app

To manually remove hooks:
1. Edit `~/.zshrc` (or equivalent) and remove the `# --- Ani-Mime Terminal Hook ---` block
2. Edit `~/.claude/settings.json` and remove entries containing `127.0.0.1:1234`
3. Edit `~/.claude.json` and remove the `"ani-mime"` entry from `"mcpServers"` (or run `claude mcp remove ani-mime`)
