# Ani-Mime

A floating macOS desktop mascot (pixel dog) that reacts to terminal and Claude Code activity in real-time. Built with Tauri 2 + React 19.

## Commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Dev | `bun run tauri dev` |
| Build | `bun run tauri build` |
| Type check frontend | `npx tsc --noEmit` |
| Type check backend | `cd src-tauri && cargo check` |
| Package manager | Bun (not npm/yarn) |

## Data Flow

```
Shell hooks (curl) → HTTP :1234 → Rust state → Tauri event → React UI
```

## Architecture (C3)

The `.c3/` directory contains C3 architecture documentation — system context, container breakdowns, and component details with diagrams and dependency maps.

**When to use C3 docs**: Cross-container changes, understanding system boundaries, onboarding context, or design decisions that span multiple subsystems. For implementation-level work within a single area, prefer the `docs/` guides above.

| Level | Document | Use for |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Context | [.c3/README.md](.c3/README.md) | System overview, actors, constraints, container map |
| Container | [.c3/c3-1-rust-backend/](.c3/c3-1-rust-backend/) | Backend boundary, component inventory |
| Container | [.c3/c3-2-react-frontend/](.c3/c3-2-react-frontend/) | Frontend boundary, component inventory |
| Container | [.c3/c3-3-shell-integration/](.c3/c3-3-shell-integration/) | Shell hooks boundary, component inventory |

## Critical Rules

- **Port 1234** is hardcoded across shell scripts, Claude hooks, and Rust server (override via `ANI_MIME_PORT` env var)
- **pid=0** is reserved for Claude Code hooks (virtual session, never times out)
- **Status priority**: `busy > service > idle > disconnected` — always one winner across all terminals
- **Three shells must stay in sync**: any change to shell hooks must be applied to zsh, bash, AND fish
- **Frontend/backend status strings** are synced manually (no codegen) — update both sides
